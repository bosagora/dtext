/*******************************************************************************

    Common struct to store `ocean.util.log` event internally

    Contains all information about a logging event, and is passed around
    between methods once it has been determined that the invoking logger
    is enabled for output.

    Note that Event instances are maintained in a freelist rather than
    being allocated each time, and they include a scratchpad area for
    EventLayout formatters to use.
